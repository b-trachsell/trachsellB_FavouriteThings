## Favourite Things Assignment
### Breanna Trachsell


### Term Three - F-2021 - IDP31

A single page application that showcases four of my favorite things, in a non-exhaustive, non-consecutive, list.
The styling of this site is inspired by early 2000s, early internet, minimalistic, geocities site design.
The site showcases database functionality, taking information from a database and displaying it on the page, and 
with the aid of javascript, display certain portions of the page at certain times.

I haven't coded anything properly in almost 2 years and although this application sucks, I am still proud of what I have Made; lol.
